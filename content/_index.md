description: "A global network of academic researchers, advocates, and practitioners working across sectors, contexts, and geographies to study the interlinkage of lending and human values."
who_we_are: "The Dignity + Debt Network, a collaboration between Princeton University and the Social Science Research Council, is a group of experts across a dozen countries developing meaningful, data-rich analyses and innovative financial services for low and moderate income households. Rather than using stories and texts as anecdotes, the network combines both richly-detailed case studies and experiments and computational analysis of large bodies of texts to assess the meanings and values that affect financial capability and well-being."
