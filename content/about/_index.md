The Dignity + Debt Network, a collaboration between Princeton University and the Social Science Research Council, is a group of experts across a dozen countries developing meaningful, data-rich analyses and innovative financial services for low and moderate income households. Rather than using stories and texts as anecdotes, the network combines both richly-detailed case studies and experiments and computational analysis of large bodies of texts to assess the meanings and values that affect financial capability and well-being. This combination enables questions, such as how do different meanings of dignity and respect affect which debts consumers are likely to repay first, and why? How do meaningful values operate in face-to-face versus virtual encounters with financial service providers, and how do different types of narratives (and the values they carry) affect how consumers achieve financial well-being? Finally, Dignity + Debt Network members will collaborate to redesign existing financial services and to test new dignity-affirming financial products.
