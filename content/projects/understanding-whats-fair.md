This project asks what are the folk understandings of fairness when using financial services and, in particular, when dealing with consumer financial service providers and debt collectors. What metaphors and images are used to relay the experience of fairness or unfairness, of respect or disrespect? Using computational techniques to analyze thousands of textual complaints from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (USA), the Public Defender Office of Over-Indebtedness (Brazil), and a private sector consumer complaints database in Brazil as well as discussions on Twitter and other social media platforms about financial service providers acting unfairly or disrespectfully. In-depth interviews with individuals at complaints bureaus/ desks as well as with consumers will round out the project. Funding for this project has come from the [Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth](https://mastercardcenter.org/). Expected competition: April 2019.
