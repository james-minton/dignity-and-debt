    Collaborating with the <a href="https://kellercenter.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Keller Center</a> at Princeton, this project would innovate on the <a href="https://tigerchallenge.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Tiger Challenge</a> model to assemble undergraduate and graduate students alongside practitioners and beneficiaries to modify existing financial products and to build new ones. The project would include measures of dignity and respect to assess whether dignity has a payoff for service providers (repayment likelihoods) and for consumers (attitudes towards financial services, their willingness to pursue full financial inclusion, and their financial well-being).  The project would also develop a small team of research fellows for ongoing computational analyses. (September 2018 to May 2020.)"
