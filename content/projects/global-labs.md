    Research teams working in about a dozen countries are assembling data on debt and human values, namely dignity, respect, and economic morality. Team members include qualitative researchers, computational social scientists, and quantitative analysts. These teams are developing insights into financial well-being that goes beyond how much people need and how much they owe. We investigate the meaningful qualities of economic life that inform the decisions consumers make about educating and providing for their children, finding a safe place to live, and participating honorably in their communities. And we demonstrate how these values and social relationships can be identified and tested for their effects on consumer financial behaviors. Special attention is given to the narratives consumers tell and those told about them—narratives that motivate, modify, or preclude action.

    <br><br>The Dignity + Debt Network has already launched one demonstration project, "What’s Fair in Finance", and intends to initiate three more. These projects rely on partnerships with academic and non-academic institutions in the Global South, making the experience of the SSRC in Africa especially important for demonstrating its capacity to coordinate with researchers and practitioners to efficaciously administer research grants.
