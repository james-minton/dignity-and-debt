blurb: "We plan to change the conversation about credit and debt among those measuring financial access and wellness, such as those writing legislation on credit access and debt, and those providing financial services. By developing novel visualizations of dignity and debt along with podcasts of conversations among researchers, journalists, civic and political leaders, and television, radio, and social media personalities, we aim to make the collective wisdom of the Network immediately relevant and usable. The network will develop strategies to address the populist backlash against globalization so that its positives are not conflated with its negatives, pointing the way to more fruitful relations between finance and society."
