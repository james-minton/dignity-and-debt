blurb: "Our first objective is to ask whether a business case be made for using respect to improve customer experience and to reduce the cost of loan defaults? Does the inclusion of respect decrease the cost of debt collection while increasing consumer financial well-being? Our approach brings together computational social scientists with qualitative researchers and practitioners to analyze how consumers think about whatâ€™s fair when confronting fees, fines, and debt collectors, as well as how and why they interpret their encounters with banks and other financial service providers as respectful, disrespectful, affirming, or degrading."
