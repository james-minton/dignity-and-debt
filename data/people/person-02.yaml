blurb: >
  Frederick F. Wherry is Professor of Sociology and the Departmental Representative. He earned his PhD in sociology from Princeton in 2004 and his MPA from the Woodrow Wilson School in 2000. He uses qualitative and comparative methods to ask how race and other identities matter in the marketplace, how individuals make sense of credit and debt, and why some communities (but not others) can more easily use their cultural traditions to revitalize their neighborhoods. He is the vice-president of the Social Science History Association and will serve as its president after November 2017. He is also chair-elect of the Economic Sociology Section of the American Sociological Association and past-chair of the Consumers and Consumption Section.
